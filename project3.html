											<h3>Project description.</h3>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>This project is formed by two individual parts and one group one. 
												The subject I will talk about is 3D printing and 3D scanning.</p>
											<p>In the first part of my project, I designed a model for 3D printing using Autodesk Fusion 360 and Prusa MK3+. In the picture below you can see the designing process for a lamp, actually a multifuncional furniture object, can be seen also as a vase.</p> 
											<div class="image">
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/laser and 3D/3D Autodesk fusion.jpg" /></span>
												<p> After that I exported the file in stl format and imported it in Prusa MK3+. </p> 
												<div class="image">
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/laser and 3D/3D Prusa .jpg" /></span>
											</div>
											<p>I cleaned the printer base and applied glue so I started to preheat the panel. Following some pics and video of the 3D printing process.</p>

											<p>The final result.</p>

											</div>
											<p>After that I noticed extra material inside my object caused by 3D Printing over Extrusion. Over extrusion in 3D printing refers to an excessive amount of filament emitted from the 3D printer nozzle onto the build bed. This issue typically has something to do with improper settings of parameters in 3D printers, such as printing temperature and speed. </p>

											</div>
											<p>In the second part of the project, I have 3D scanning an object, a ship using Polycam. I took multiple pictures and got a video as a production result.</p>

											<p>The last part of the project is a group part. Me with my colleague Halld√≥r have designed a model test-experiment to be able to determine design rules / constraints for our 3D printer.(For example need for support, wall thickness, printing direction, surface quality, filling...). We have been assigned to register the conclusions on a common site. <a href="https://gitgud069.github.io/VEL608G_Verkefni_1/V3Prentun.html">Here is his blog post.</a></p>
												<p>We started designing a vase model test to use to determine support, wall thickness, printing direction, surface quality, filling of our Prusa.</p>
												<p>We designed a vase in Autodesk Fusion 360 and using it as an example-test experiment for our purpose.</p>
											<div class="image">
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/laser and 3D/Vase test.jpg" /></span>
											</div>
												<p>The printer has not been able to reproduce the object cause of multiple layers of materials that didn't allow the machine to work properly. As it's possible to visualize in the picture below, we stopped the machine and we got our conclusions. </p>

											</div>
											<p>Multiple layers of materials didn't allow us to get the final results but this has been a good example for our experiment-purpose</p>
											<p>Supports are the printed structures that hold up overhangs on prints, and they're necessary because a printer can't print in mid-air and they are always below the structure.</p>
												<p>We registered a wall thickness of 0,05mm and printer axes x and z. Surface y-axis.</p>
												<p>Surface quality Mid to High and rectilinear infill patterns. This is a pretty basic infill pattern that creates a rectilinear grid by printing one layer in one direction., the next one rotated by 90 grades. Compared to Grid pattern, Rectilinear has double the support for top layers using the same amount of material. This type of infill is the only one recommended for 100% infill printing.</p>
