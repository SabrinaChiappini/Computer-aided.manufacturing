											<p>This last project is a group one. </p>
                                             
											<p>Components of the group: Sabrina Chiappini, Margrét Maren Guðmundsdóttir, Hanna Mae Isorena Guðjónsdóttir.
											</p>

                                            <p>  I will describe the project in my personal page and the common group page will be linked to get an overview of the entire project and details.</p>

								
											
										<p><b>Introduction to the project</b></p>
	                                    <p><b>IDEA AND FIRST APPROACH:</b></p>
                                        <p>We started the process by choosing between two projects, we had the opportunity to select one between the following:

                                         Choose one:
                                         1. Design, draw, prepare and mill something with Shop Bot. Plan and document feeds and speeds, toolpaths, etc. for what was designed. 
                                         Register the project and the results on a common website.
                                         Available will be 1500x1500mm of 18mm plywood. (will be updated later with more details).
                                         For example, interior design, furniture, wall art, frames
 
                                         2. Design, draw, prepare and mill molds in wax with Roland SRM-20. Prepare toolpaths, both roughing and finishing. Register the project and the results on a common website. Read the MSDS and plan based on them if necessary.
                                         15x7x4cm wax and silicone for mold making will be available.
                                         For example, a component, a toy, a container, hung on a wall.

                                         We chose the first one and the idea that won, at the end, has been a Minibar to ideate in Fusion 360 and then produce using the machine Shop Bot. </p>


                                         <p> The Fusion 360 file is here attached:</p>

                                            <p>  After creating our MiniBar in Fusion 360, we produced it and here you can see a video of the process:

											</p>
											
										

                                        <p> It took a long time to produce it, but the process has been very interesting. I personally enjoyed learning more about the machine Shop Bot. (Talking about the machine)
                                        CNC machines, or computer numerically controlled machines, are electro-mechanical devices that can manipulate tools around a varying number of axes, usually 3 or 5, with high precision per instruction from a computer program. CNC machining is one of two ways that generate a physical part from a computer design file and subtractive manufacturing (CNC machining) is the machining process in which solid piece of raw material is carved into a desired 3D geometrical shape and size by using a controlled material-removal process. </p>
                                        
										<p> When all the pieces were completed, we assembled them and here it’s possible to see the results. </p>

                                       <p> I have been involved in the process with two other colleagues and I have done the post below, as a good presentation of the idea.</p>

                                       <p> We have been using Trello vinnuskjal to define tasks and time for a good time and project management. We did almost everything together, ideation production and presentation and I have done the post and videos.

											 </p>
                                       <p>
										After concluding our MiniBar, we made a video illustrating our presentation of the project. Here is the video we made together.

									        CONCLUSIONS
									        CHALLENGES AND RESOLUTIONS:</b></p>
                                           <p> It was the first time we were dealing with the machine Shot Bot, so we got help from the teacher Hafliði Ásgeirsson to be able to set up the machine and we have been wearing glasses for eye protection while dealing with it. The process took around 3/ 4 hours, and we spent an entire evening looking at the process to pay attention that everything was working properly. 
                                           </p>
