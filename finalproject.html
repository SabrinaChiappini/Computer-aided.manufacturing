											<p>I have been using <a href="https://html5up.net/">https://html5up.net/</a> to choose the template that I found to be the best option to describe my work during this course. I chose the template called “Story” because I liked how the material is organised, the design and graphics are very well presented in a way that attracts the reader.</p>
											<div class="image">
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/templateshot.png" alt="" /></span>
											</div>
											<p>The design shows the information with a practical approach and I chose colours that make  an impact while reading.</p>
											<p>I download the software <a href="https://brackets.io/">https://brackets.io/</a> for the code editing environment of my website and selected the option Live preview to be able to see the changes while I'm editing on my computer.</p>
											<div class="image">
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/bracketsshot.png" alt="" /></span>
											</div>
											<p>I also downloaded <a href="https://git-scm.com/">https://git-scm.com/</a> but didn't use it because I don't need to command my computer to upload the code to the website repository project I created in <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a> as there is a button there called 'Add files' that does the same thing. To create a repository project in Github I created an account which is the centre to which everything connects. So my website has a link to the Github repository. Here the link to my repository
												<a href="https://github.com/SabrinaChiappini/Computer-aided.manufacturing"> https://github.com/SabrinaChiappini/Computer-aided.manufacturing</a>
													<p>
											<div class="image">
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/reposcreenshot.png" alt="" /></span>
											</div>
											<div class="image">
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/reposhot.png" alt="" /></span>
											</div>
											<p>To add screenshots I looked at the code for the Story template and copied the following text:</p>
											<div class="image">
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/imagecodeshot.png" alt="" /></span>
											</div>
											<p>To get the right image I had to make sure to change the 'src='-line to the path to the image for every screenshot.</p>
											<p>I had a problem with the size of the images. They were too big and extended outside the screen. To fix this, I tried to find code to automatically make the images fit but this was hard and required CSS-coding. So I looked at the Story-template and found a section where the images were made to fit the screen. So the person who made the Story-template had already fixed this problem and all I had to do was add the following code around the line that linked to the image:</p>
											<div class="image">
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/fitimages.png" alt="" /></span>
											</div>
											<p>A challenge I encountered, while working on my website, has been to create a subpage from the presentation of the first project, a subpage to which get access from pushing the button “Learn more” under each main chapter title. This challenge has been overcome understanding what to write in my code on brackets and how to do it. To create a subpage, I created a new HTML-file in the folder that also contains the index.html-file, and called it project1.html. I copied a section from the Story live demo near the bottom called 'Additional Elements' and edited it to make this project section and made sure the new website looked right. Then I tried to find guides on how to make a subpage on Github. Eventually I realized that simply by uploading the file to the repository, Github publishes it automatically. <br>
											All I had to do was use the website address form 'https://sabrinachiappini.github.io/Computer-aided.manufacturing' and add '/project1.html' at the end.</p>
											
											<p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
											<p>In my website I will talk about myself through my resume and will make the portfolio of this course in computer manufacturing.<br>
											I think that many different topics will be covered and that it will be enjoyable to introduce them through this website. In my final project I would like to use the knowledge gained during the course and talk about manufacturing, design and materials choices that are fundamental  basics of digital production technology and computer- aided production. </p>
