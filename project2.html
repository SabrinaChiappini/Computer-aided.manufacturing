											<p>This project is formed by two individual parts and one group one. 
												<br>
												<br>
												<p><b>FIRST PART<p><b>
													<br>
												<p>The topic of the first part is about designing a parametric, press-fit model of building blocks for laser cutting.
												<p>
												<p>In the first part of the project, I have been using Inkscape to produce a cutting surface 100x50cm, maximun size, and getting a Sticker from that. The following image is showing the operation done.</p>

													<br>
												    <br>
										      <p><b>SECOND PART<p><b>
												  <br>
											<p>In the second part of the project, I designed a parametric model and produced it. Below all the steps documenting the process.</p>
												  <br>
										<p><b>DISCUSSION ABOUT IDEATION PROCESS AND FLOW CHART OF THE IDEA DEVELOPED.</b><p>
											
											</p>The ideation process began with what idea to produce,the outcome was a box for small objects for example jewellery.
                                            I decided to produce a small model of a box with a lid made partially with glass. The box has inside a panel to create different compartments for small objects.
                                            I  had to decide how to organise my work so I drew, with a drawing application on my phone a small example to reproduce. Here the example I used as a sample.

											<div class="image">
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/DrawingSketch.jpg" alt="" /></span> </div>
												  <p>
											
											<p>I used Autodesk Fusion 360 to design a parametric, press-fit Jewellery box model and getting it ready for laser cutting. I followed various steps to produce my object. </p>
											<p>I started preparing the model and decided the parameters to design my Jewellery box size. </p>

											<p>A video showing how I designed the model. I progetted fingers (joint points) around the base panel and on the box laterals and, after that, (this is not visible in the video) I added fingers on the lateral panels to make sure the panel inside the box is well designed and stable. The internal component, I added inside the box, is designed to make the Jewelllery box more organised, practical and ergonomic so that it's possible to organize small objects inside the box. </p>

											<p> To be able to reproduce my box puzzle, I prepared it in Autodesk Fusion 360, ready for laser cutting. Here you can see how I layed the single components to be able to open the file in Inkskape and laser cutting the components of my box after that. </p>

											<p>Below, just a pic of the laser cutting process, a thermal process in which a focused laser beam is used to melt material in a localised area. A co-axial gas jet is used to eject the molten material and create a kerf. A continuous cut is produced by moving the laser beam or workpiece under CNC control (Computer numerical control).

											<p>At this point, my Jewellery box was ready and this is a collage where I'm showing the final result. </p>

												  <p><b>CONCLUSIONS, CHALLENGES AND RESOLUTIONS.</b></p>
												  <br>
												  <p>I had problems with realising lateral fingers in the lateral panels to be able to fit properly the internal panel inside the box. After some attempts I figured out how to add them in Autodesk fusion. After sketching them, I extruded and pushed the bottom “Modify and Combine.” A menu will appear on the screen and you will be prompted to select a Target body and Tool body as well as the type of operation. It’s possible to choose between Join, Cut, or Intersect. Once I had Target and Tool bodies selected, I choose to Cut and hit OK to complete the operation. In this way the internal panel was perfectly fitting inside the box. 
                                                  I had fun working with this project and I spent time understanding how to use Autodesk fusion 360 properly so that my project was ok for laser cutting.

												  <br>
												  <br>
												  <p><b>THIRD PART (GROUP PROJECT)<p><b>
											
											<p>The last part of the project is a group one. Me with my colleague Halldór have been calculating the Kerf of the laser. The laser burns away a portion of material when it cuts through and it's important to be aware of that in the phase object production </p>
											
											<p> Here I'm showing the Kerf calculation process. We arried at the conclusion that subtracting 9,94cm to 10,04 cm, we get our Kerf that will be 0,1 cm so 1 mm. This is fine as it's known that the laser kerf ranges from 0.08mm – 1mm . Here an image of the process.</p>
